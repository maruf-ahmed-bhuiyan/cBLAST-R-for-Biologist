## R for Biologist

### Overview

This is a 5-day Fully online training that will introduce participants the basics of R and Rstudio. R is one of the leading programming languages in Biology and Data Science. It is widely used to perform statistics, machine learning, visualisations and data analyses. It is an open source programming language so all the software we will use in the course is free. This course is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. We will start from scratch by introducing how to start programming in R and progress our way and learn how to read and write to files, manipulate data and visualise it by creating different plots - all the fundamental tasks you need to get you started analysing your data. 

These materials are intended to provide both basic R programming knowledge and its application for increasing efficiency for data analysis.
