# Define the variable vegas

##Create Vector 2

#Perfect! Notice that adding a space behind the commas in the 
#c() function improves the readability of your code. Let's practice 
#some more with vector creation in the next exercise.

##Very good! To check out the contents of your vectors, 
#remember that you can always simply type the variable in 
#the console and hit Enter. Proceed to the next exercise!


##Naming a vector
